# Helpers to allow you to override your keys in talon community

I found it difficult to override my keys in talon community without forking the repository. I made this repository to make it possible for anyone to override their keys without having to fork the repository.

## Usage

All you need to do is clone this repository and define the override talon list files anywhere you like. My recommendation is to copy these files into your own local configuration repository and then they will be replacing anything in talon community.
